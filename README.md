# Cloudevents.live - website

This repository contains the CloudEvents.live website. It's not very
interesting as the UI for the main app is located on
[klira/cloudevents-debugger](https://github.com/klira/cloudevents-debugger)
and the backend is at
[klira/cloudevents-bin](https://github.com/klira/cloudevents-debugger)
